Title: Password Reset Feature Email Verification

 Finding: The password reset feature relies solely on email delivery, which may be susceptible to unauthorized access if the user's email account is compromised.

 Recommendation: Implement an additional verification step, such as security questions or two-factor authentication, to complement the 6-digit code sent via email.
