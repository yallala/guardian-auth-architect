# GuardianAuth Security Audit Report


---


## Project Overview and Audit Scope
### The project, GuardianAuth, addresses authentication security for internal corporate applications. Its scope includes validating and enhancing practices surrounding user registration, particularly with verified corporate email domains, namely "@guardian.com". 


---


## Registration Process Security Assessment  

### Validation of Email Domain Constraints  
- GuardianAuth correctly enforces the use of corporate emails ending in "@guardian.com" for registration. This limits access to company employees only.  
- A hostname validation mechanism exists to ensure compliance with required domain standards, minimizing risks from external non-compliant email domains.  

### Risks of Bypassing Domain Validation  
- Audit teams identified a potential loophole wherein subdomain addresses (e.g., "spoof@sub.guardian.com") could theoretically bypass domain verification without a strict regex check.  
- Recommendations include strengthening domain validation logic with stricter whitelisting and ongoing anomaly detection.  

### Security Impacts of Domain Enforcement  
- The restriction ensures data segregation, reducing exposure to third-party or malicious actors attempting unauthorized access.  
- However, exposure may occur if external collaborators or partnerships require access but cannot use "@guardian.com." Guardrails for temporary access delegation should be considered.

## User Onboarding and Email Privacy  

### Risks of Oversharing Domain Information  
- Explicit use of a corporate domain in user registration can expose Guardian's internal email convention publicly. This could increase phishing risk vectors targeting "username@guardian.com."  
- Recommendations include implementing unique hashed email identifiers for login showing email only at critical confirmation or communication stages.  

### Multi-Factor Authentication Enforcement  
- Despite email-based filtration, GuardianAuth still needs stronger combined authentication such as hardware-backed MFA tokens to reduce reliance on email verification alone.  

### Email Creation Audit Trails  
- Logs associated with account registration display sufficient timestamps, error checks, and failure reports. This is beneficial under regulatory inspections (e.g., GDPR data tracking requirements).

## Breach Simulations and Stress Testing  

### Protecting Against Credential Stuffing  
- Tests demonstrated moderate resilience in rejecting repeated corporate credential stuffing attacks. It lacked direct CAPTCHA/advanced rate limits under this model.  
### Ensure locked out detection runs permanent-limited intervals, tighter Ant-level-area logging monitoring over Apps real-time
